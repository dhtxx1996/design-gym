**pH-Sensitive Binder Design - Ground Truth Answers**

## Part 0: Conceptual Understanding

**Question 0.1**: B) His has a pKa (~6.0) near physiological/endosomal pH, allowing protonation state changes

**Question 0.2**: B) His adjacent to Arg/Lys (positively charged residues)
- At low pH, His becomes protonated (+1), causing electrostatic repulsion with nearby Arg/Lys (+1)

**Question 0.3**: C) Buried in the protein core
- Buried networks destabilize the monomer fold when His protonates at low pH

**Question 0.4**: A) His-His, His-Arg, His-Lys networks
- These polar/charged networks are disrupted by His protonation

**Question 0.5**: B) His H-bond energy < -0.5 kcal/mol (favorable)
- Networks must have sufficiently strong H-bonds to be functional at neutral pH

## Part 1: ProteinMPNN with Histidine Bias

**Task 1.1**: The correct bias argument is:
```
--bias_AA "H:2.0"
```

**Task 1.2**: Position-specific bias dictionary:
```python
def create_his_bias_dict(positions, chain="A", his_bias=3.0):
    bias_dict = {}
    for pos in positions:
        key = f"{chain}{pos}"
        bias_dict[key] = {aa: (his_bias if aa == "H" else 0.0) for aa in AA_ALPHABET}
    return bias_dict

# Result for positions [10, 15, 22]:
{
    "A10": {"A": 0.0, "C": 0.0, ..., "H": 3.0, ..., "Y": 0.0},
    "A15": {"A": 0.0, "C": 0.0, ..., "H": 3.0, ..., "Y": 0.0},
    "A22": {"A": 0.0, "C": 0.0, ..., "H": 3.0, ..., "Y": 0.0}
}
```

## Part 2: Interface Destabilization Scoring (Strategy A)

**Task 2.1**: His-cation motif detection requires:
1. Identify His residues at interface (within 5Å of target)
2. Find Arg/Lys residues within H-bond distance (3.5Å) of His ND1/NE2 atoms
3. Valid pairs: His-Nδ1...Arg-Nη1/Nη2 or His-Nε2...Lys-Nζ

**Task 2.2**: PyRosetta scoring pipeline:
```python
# Key steps:
1. pose = pyrosetta.pose_from_pdb(pdb_path)
2. sfxn = pyrosetta.get_fa_scorefxn()
3. FastRelax().apply(pose)
4. InterfaceAnalyzerMover("A_B").apply(pose)
5. Extract: dG_separated, dSASA_int, fa_elec
```

**Task 2.3**: Filtering criteria:
- Pass if: (num_his_cation_pairs >= 1) AND (ddG_elec >= 0)

## Part 3: Monomer Destabilization with HBNet (Strategy B)

**Task 3.1**: Core residue identification:
- Calculate relative SASA for each residue
- Core = residues with relative SASA < 25%
- Use FreeSASA or BioPython SASA module

**Task 3.2**: HBNet configuration:
```python
# Key settings:
- core_selector = ResidueIndexSelector(core_positions)
- allowed_aas = "HRK"  # His, Arg, Lys
- min_network_size = 2
- require_his = True
```

**Task 3.3**: Scoring criterion:
- His H-bond energy < -0.5 kcal/mol
- Extract from HBondSet for each His in network

**Task 3.4**: Complete pipeline:
1. identify_core_residues() → core positions
2. setup_hbnet_for_his_networks() → configured HBNet
3. hbnet.apply(pose) → designs with networks
4. score_hbnet_designs() → filtered candidates
